# Go-Straight
Go Straight, a 2D Hyper Casual Game
Try to move through the wood logs in the river by navigating your boat. However there is a catch, you can only move diagonally!

###### How to play
In Go Straight, the main goal is to score as much as you can. Each time you pass between 2 logs you earn 1 point. If you touch the logs or touch the shore the game ends. 
- After the game ends, you can watch a short ad to try again from where you left of.
- You can collect stars to unlock different boats in the shop.
- You can collect and use powerups to make the game easier.
  - **Shrink:** power-ups shrinks the boat so you can pass through the logs with ease.
  - **Giant:** power-up makes the boat bigger and your boat can now break the logs it touched.
  - **Anchor:** slows down the speed of the boat so you can calculate your moves easier.
  - **Vanish:** removes 5 logs infront of you and add 5 to your score.

## Notes
- Go Straight is a game made using the Unity Game Engine.
- All assets are drawn by me using piskel app.
- This is my first experiment with making a proper game for publishing to the store.
